**PROJECT ABOUT EDA METHODOLOGY, MODELING SYSTEM AND RECOMMENDATIONS**

I conducted an analysis in Netflix 's dataset focusing on understanding *user preferences for the most popular films released until 2021 in the platform*.

# DATA ANALYSIS ABOUT NETFLIX:
I present an analysis of the dataset where the Netflix platform collects all the information about the movies and series offered, which needs a data cleaning and transformation to later, based on user preferences, provide a list of recommendations for a better experience according to the similarity of what each customer tuned in.
 
## OBJECTIVES
- **Clean and Transform data**: Detect values that need to consistency (dupplicated and missing values).
- **Perform exploratory data analysis**: Use statisticians technical to understand data for discover patterns (Histograms,Bar plot, Pie chart and WordCloud). 
- **Recommendation System**: Development of the list of titles most similar to the consumer's preferences.
  
## KEY RESULTS
- The most offered programs on the platform are catalogued for adults and these represent 36.4%.
- The type of content most offered is dominated by movies.
- A list of movies similar to the 'Alien TV' film was found, as well as series in the style of 'The Walking Dead'

This project allowed me to detect a wide variety of ways to clean the database which included the removal and replacement of missing, inconsistent and invalid values
that required urgent treatment in order to obtain a satisfactory exploratory analysis, it also allowed me to implement my basic knowledge of machine learning through a system of recommendations that help optimize the customer experience according to the visual products offered through the platform.
